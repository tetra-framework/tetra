This diretory just contains some commonly used fixtures, tools and urlpaths for both Tetra internal testing and development of your own components that need to be tested too.

You can use those in your own tests. However, we can't put them into the global "tests" folder, as it is no namespace within tetra you can import. So it lives here.
