Tetra is a full stack component framework for [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com) using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), bridging the gap between your server logic and front end presentation. It is built on a couple of key principles:

  - Proximity of related concerns is as important as separation of concerns. Whilst it is important to keep your backend logic, front end JavaScript, HTML, and styles separate, it is also incredibly useful to have related code in close proximity.

    Front end toolkits such as Vue.js, with its single file components and newer "utility class" based CSS frameworks such as Tailwind, have shown that keeping related aspects of a component in the same file helps to reduce code rot, and to improve the speed at which developers gain an understanding of the component.

  - Building APIs as a bridge between your server side and front end code adds complexity and developer overhead - Tetra allows for much less of this. Server side rendering allows you to move more quickly without having to create further layers and abstractions.
  
    Frameworks such as Laravel Livewire and Phoenix Liveview, which heavily inspired Tetra, have shown that server side rendering with smart "morphing" of the DOM in the browser is an incredibly efficient way to build websites and apps.

Tetra components encapsulate all aspects of their functionality into one definition in a single file/directory. The server side Python/Django code, HTML template, front end JavaScript (using Alpine.js), and CSS styles are side by side.

Furthermore, components can expose attributes and methods as *public*, making them available to the front end Alpine.js JavaScript code.

[Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) is a lightweight front end toolkit that exposes a reactive state to your html, providing a way to build front end components. If you haven't previously used Alpine.js, now is the time to go and follow their [brief tutorial](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here ). 

*Tetra takes the four "faces" of a component and combines them into one composable object.*


## Walkthrough of a simple "To Do App"

To introduce the main aspects of Tetra we will walk through the code implementing the [To Do App demo](https://tetraframework.com/#examples) on the homepage.

*If you haven't used Django before you should follow their [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/) before coming back here.*

First, we need a Django "model" for saving our 'to do' items:


``` python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class ToDo(models.Model):
    session_key = models.CharField(max_length=40, db_index=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    done = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

Assuming we have [installed and setup](install.md) Tetra, next we create a `components/default.py` file to contain our components. Every component belongs to a "Library", this is done by putting the component class into a containing module named `default`.

``` python
# components/default.py
from sourcetypes import javascript, css, django_html
from tetra import Component, public, Library
from .models import ToDo
```

### `TodoList` Component

Next, we create a `TodoList` component by subclassing `Component`.

We also create a "public attribute" named `title`; the value of this is available to both your server side code / template *and* to your front end JavaScript / Alpine.js.

There is also a `load` method - this is called both when initially rendering the component, and when the component is "resumed" from its saved state. (More on this later)

``` python
class TodoList(Component):
    title = public("")

    def load(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.todos = ToDo.objects.filter(session_key=self.request.session.session_key)
```

Next up, we have a "public method"; these are available in the browser to your JavaScript / Alpine.js code. This creates a new `ToDo` model instance, sets its title, and saves it. Finally, the value of the  public `title` attribute is reset to an empty string, which will subsequently empty the input box after saving.

``` python
    @public
    def add_todo(self, title):
        todo = ToDo(
            title=title,
            session_key=self.request.session.session_key,
        )
        todo.save()
        self.title = ""
```

Then there is the template; this uses the standard Django template language. You will note the `django_html` type annotation, which is an  alias of  `str` and indicates to your editor to syntax highlight the following string. There is a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samwillis.python-inline-source) available.

``` python
    template: django_html = """
    <div>
        <div class="input-group mb-2">
            <input type="text" x-model="title" class="form-control" 
                placeholder="New task..." @keyup.enter="add_todo(title)">
            <button class="btn btn-primary" @click="add_todo(title)">Add</button>
        </div>
        <div class="list-group">
            {% for todo in todos %}
                {% TodoItem todo=todo key=todo.id / %}
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    </div>
    """
```

- The public `title` attribute is bound to the input value using the Alpine.js `x-model` directive.
- An Alpine.js `@keyup.enter` event listener is attached to the input, calling our `add_todo` public method when the user presses enter within the input.
- Another `@click` event listener is attached to the button, also calling our `add_todo` public method.
- A standard Django template `for` loop iterates through any 'to do' items loaded to the private `todos` attribute (see our `load` method above).
- We use the Tetra `@` component template tag to display the `to_do_item` component. We pass it a `todo` model instance as an argument, and a `key` argument set to the `todo.id`. It is  important to "key" components in loops so that when morphing the DOM they are correctly identified and updated.
- The `TodoItem` component tag can optionally take nested block content. However, in this example this is not necessary, and therefore we "close" the tag with a forward slash `/` much like with xml tags. Without explicitly closing the tag the template parser would expect a `{% /TodoItem %}` closing tag.


### `TodoItem` Component

Next, we create a `TodoItem` component.

``` python
class TodoItem(Component):
    title = public("")
    done = public(False)

    def load(self, todo, *args, **kwargs):
        self.todo = todo
        self.title = todo.title
        self.done = todo.done
```
 As we have previously seen, there are public attributes to hold the `title` and `done` status of the item. The load method takes a `ToDo` model instance (passed to it in the template above), then saves it as a private attribute on the component, and finally sets the `title` and `done` public attributes.



``` python
    @public.watch('title', 'done').debounce(200)
    def save(self, value, old_value, attr):
        self.todo.title = self.title
        self.todo.done = self.done
        self.todo.save()
```

The public `save` method is set to `watch` the `title` and `done` public attributes with a `debounce` of 200ms. This instructs Alpine.js to call the server side `save` method automatically whenever the `title` and `done` attributes change. The `debounce(200)` ensures that the save method isn't called on every keystroke whilst typing.

Next, there is a public `delete_item` method, which is simply calling the delete method on the Django model instance attached to the component.

``` python
    @public(update=False)
    def delete_item(self):
        self.todo.delete()
        self.client._removeComponent()
```

 However, there are a couple of other things happening in there too:

- We have set `update=False` when creating the public method. By default, public methods will re-render the component and send the new html to the browser. However, in this instance we don't need to do this, and have therefore disabled it.
- We call `self.client._removeComponent()`
- `self.client` is a "callback queue" that allows you to schedule callbacks of client JavaScript methods for when the client receives a response from the method. You can call any of your custom JavaScript methods via this API. The `self.client._removeComponent()` is a method available on all components, instructing the client to remove the component from the DOM - this is ideal for when deleting items.


This component template uses some concepts we saw on the previous component, attaching public attributes to inputs with the Alpine.js `x-model` directive and event listeners with the `@event` directives. In this case we are binding `@keydown.backspace` and `@keyup.backspace` on the text input to custom JavaScript methods which we are going to define later on.

We have used the Alpine.js class binding `:class` to set the CSS class depending on the `done` attribute.

``` python
    template: django_html = """
    <div class="list-group-item d-flex gap-1 p-1">
        <label class="align-middle px-2 d-flex">
            <input class="form-check-input m-0 align-self-center" type="checkbox"
                x-model="done">
        </label>
        <input 
            type="text" 
            class="form-control border-0 p-0 m-0"
            :class="{'text-muted': done, 'todo-strike': done}"
            x-model="title"
            maxlength="80"
            @keydown.backspace="inputDeleteDown()"
            @keyup.backspace="inputDeleteUp()"
        >
        <button @click="delete_item()" class="btn btn-sm">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i>
        </button>
    </div>
    """
```

This component introduces the concept of client side JavaScript methods; these are created on the `script` attribute as a multiline Python string. We are again using the `javascript` type annotation to indicate to our editor which syntax highlighting to use.

The script should use `export default` to expose an object that is used to construct the Alpine.js component - this is mixed in with your component's public attributes/methods, along with some additional Tetra methods to `Alpine.data()`. You can read more about [Alpine.data](https://alpinejs.dev/globals/alpine-data).

If you are using other JavaScript libraries it is possible to `import` them here.

Your JavaScript is "built" using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), packaging all components within one "library" into a single package. Sourcemaps are created, mapping back to your original Python files to aid in debugging.

Note that our `inputDeleteUp` method below calls `this.delete_item()` -  this is a public method implemented in Python above. Convention is to use "snake_case" for Python methods and attributes, and "camelCase" for JavaScript methods and attributes, for ease of identification.

``` python
    script: javascript = """
    export default {
        lastTitleValue: "",
        inputDeleteDown() {
            this.lastTitleValue = this.title;
        },
        inputDeleteUp() {
            if (this.title === "" && this.lastTitleValue === "") {
                // If the input was all ready empty when we pressed backspace then
                // delete the to do item.
                this.delete_item()
            }
        }
    }
    """
```

Next, we define some CSS styles for the component as the multiline Python string attribute `styles`. This again uses a `css` type annotation for syntax highlighting. Styles for all components in a library are bundled together using esbuild, and again source maps are generated, mapping back to the original Python source code.

``` python
    style: css = """
    .todo-strike {
        text-decoration: line-through;
    }
    """
```

### Including the "todo" list in a page

Finally, we include our `TodoList` component into a pages template using the component tag.
As we are doing this outside of a Tetra component we need to explicitly load the Tetra template tags with `{% load tetra %}`.

``` django
{# index.html #}
<h4>Your todo list:</h4>
{% TodoList / %}
```

 To get started, follow the [install instructions](install.md).

!!! note
    Tetra is still early in its development, and we can make no promises about API stability at this stage.

    The intention is to stabilise the API prior to a v1.0 release, as well as implementing additional functionality step by step.
